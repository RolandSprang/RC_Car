## About
A simple Arduino project for a RC-"robot"-Car.

It's planned that this car can drive by itselfe using a ultrasonic sensor.
It also should be  controlled remote using a 433Mhz funkmodule and in distant future controllable via Internet using a ESP8266 module.

The current setup uses a standart 2WD Smart-Car-Kit from Ebay as startpoint.
This set contains:
* Acrylic base for mounting motors, Sensors and Microcontrollers 
* Arduino Uno
* H-Bridge
* Battery-Case
* 2 DC Gear Motors
* 1 SG90 Servo
* Ultrasnoic Sensor HC-SR04
* Cabel and mounting-tools

## WIP
* Implement Distance detection
* Finit State Maschine
* Changing IDE (Arduino IDE -> Eclipse/VSC)

## Planned improvementds
* RC Controll via 433 Module
